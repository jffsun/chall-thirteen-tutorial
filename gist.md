## Notes

- What: regex for short. a Tool. a sequence of characters that define a search pattern for a body of text. can find Literal or Meta (general) characters 
- Ex: Search for all phone numbers in body of text
- How: meta character '\d' = characters 0-9; for first 3 numbers of phone number (ie. 949-123-1234) => \d\d\d - \d\d\d - \d\d\d\d; 
- In the find bar, enable Regular expressions or Regex using the wildcard '.*' '.' means any character; "asterisk" is a quantifier meaning 0 or more.
- Sample Meta Characters
'\d' for digit = characters 0-9
'\w' for word = characters A-Z, a-z, and 0-9
'\s' for whitespace = space / tab
'.' = any character whatsoever

Examples above are lower case and capital letters represent the OPPOSITE of the search or ANYTHING NOT
'\D' = anything NOT a digit
'\W' = any characters NOT A-Z, a-z, or 0-9
'\S' = anything NOT whitespace

- Quantifiers (how many)
- What: Modify metacharacters and detail HOW MANY characters we want to match in a row
- Sample Quantifiers
* = 0 or more
+ = 1 or more (at least one)
? = 0 or 1
